# Data Analysis Tasks, Tech her up program

This repository contains two data analysis tasks, implemented in colab notebooks, to demonstrate data processing, visualization, and analysis skills using Python.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Session 4 - Task 1

- **Description**: This notebook performs data analysis using `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
- **Objective**: The goal of this task is to process and visualize HR data to uncover insights about the employees.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.

### 2. Session 7 - Task 2

- **Description**: This notebook focuses on advanced data analysis and visualization techniques. It uses `pandas` for data processing and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for creating detailed plots.
- **Objective**: The objective of this task is to apply advanced visualization techniques to interpret and present data demonestrates factory production of different materials effectively.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: For visualizing trends and distributions.
